It's your girl Julie on Appalachia Radio, and I've got some juicy tidbits of wasteland gossip to share with you all. \n\nI heard from a reliable source that someone found an old pre-war video tape down in Cliffs Edge News. Apparently, it was just a bunch of kids messing around and making silly videos. But can you imagine seeing those faces again after all these years? Word is they're trying to restore the footage, but who knows if it'll ever see the light of day.\n\nAnd have you noticed any strange occurrences at the Abandoned Bog Copper Extraction Plant lately? I've been getting reports of weird noises and lights flickering on and off. Now, I'm no expert, but that place gives me the heebie-jeebies to begin with... What do you think it could be? Just the wind, or is something more going on? Let me know your theories!",
