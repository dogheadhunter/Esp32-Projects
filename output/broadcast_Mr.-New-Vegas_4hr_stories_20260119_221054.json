Word is, some radical NCR folks are calling for it to be torn down as a symbol of \"collaboration\" with the Desert Rangers. Can you dig it? I mean, sure, times change and alliances shift, but that monument represents an important chapter in our history here in the Mojave.\n\nSomeone told me the NCR's been having some internal debates about how much they should integrate with the independent settlements in the Wasteland. On one hand, they want to bring everyone under their protection umbrella. But on the other, they're afraid of losing their identity as a unified nation if they absorb too many different cultures.\n\nYou know, it's always a delicate dance between unity and individuality out here in the wilds. I hope cooler heads prevail when it comes to the monument - we could lose an important piece of our heritage if that happens. But hey, maybe I'm just romanticizing the past a bit.
