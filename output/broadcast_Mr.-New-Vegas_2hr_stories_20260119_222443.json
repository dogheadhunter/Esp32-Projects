Mine's been pretty swell, just spinning some tunes and keeping it groovy out here in the Mojave Wasteland.\n\nYou know, I heard from a cat who's friends with one of the NCR soldiers that there might be some trouble brewin' at Hoover Dam. Word is, those Legion fanatics have been causin' some ruckus on the other side, maybe even tryin' to infiltrate. But don't you worry, our boys and girls in blue are always ready for a scrap.\n\nOn another note, someone told me that a group of trappers out near Bitter Springs have come across some pretty rare caps stash. Now, I ain't one to spread rumors, but if it's true, those trappers might be sittin' on quite the fortune! Always nice to find some extra caps in this harsh wasteland life.\n\nWell, that's all for now, my dear. Just a couple tidbits of gossip to keep things interesting out here. Remember, until somebody loves you, you're nobody at all - and if you ever need any lovin' vibes, just tune into Radio Appalachia anytime! Your DJ, Mr. New Vegas, signing off.",
