I heard whispers that Caesar's Legion was planning a big strike against the NCR right here at Mojave Outpost, but our brave Rangers caught wind of it first and stopped 'em cold! Someone told me there were even deserters from the Legion who fled back to Arizona after they saw how outnumbered and outgunned they'd be. Word is, those renegades might just start a rebellion against Caesar himself.\n\nNow, I don't want you to go thinking this means all's well in our little corner of the Mojave, but it sure does give us hope that freedom can prevail even in these dark times. Remember, Mrs. New Vegas, till somebody loves you, you're nobody at all. And out here in the wasteland, we've got love - for each other, for our way of life, and for the brave men and women fighting to protect it all. So keep on listening, darlin', as I spin more tales of adventure and romance under the neon lights of New Vegas City!",
