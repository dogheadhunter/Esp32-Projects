Someone told me a group even tried to domesticate one, but I'm not sure how that went.\n\nOh, and word is there might be an old, abandoned settlement down there too, hidden away in the woods. Nobody knows much about it yet, so if you do stumble upon anything interesting, I'd love to hear about it! That's all for now, just some juicy wasteland gossip to spice up your day.\n\nStay safe out there, and thanks again for tuning in!",

I wanted to share a little something that caught my ear recently.\n\nWord is, there's been some unusual activity around the old mine shafts down in the Glades. Apparently, folks have spotted some kinda mutated wildlife - like gators with extra legs or snakes with multiple heads! \n\nNow, I don't know if it's just radiation playing tricks on people's minds, but if it's true... well, that'd be pretty wild, wouldn't it? \n\nI mean, we've seen some crazy stuff in Appalachia already, but mutant reptiles? That's a whole new level.\n\nJust something to keep an eye out for while you're exploring. Stay safe out there and remember, the road to recovery is bumpy, but we're all in this together!\n\nThis has been Julie from Radio Appalachia, signing off. If you're listening... know that hope lives on in these mountains.\"",
