Apparently, they're not exactly welcoming to NCR troops these days. Someone told me it's all because of that treaty they signed years back... the Ranger Unification Treaty. Seems like some folks in Nevada still feel a little bitter about joining forces with the big boys from California.\n\nNow, I don't know if there's any truth to this, but it would be swell if those Desert Rangers could put their differences aside and remember what brought them together in the first place - keeping the Legion out of our neck of the woods. But hey, that's just my two caps on the matter. What do you think, Mrs. New Vegas? Do share your thoughts...",

Those two sworn enemies digging into their shared enemy woes like old pals. It's almost enough to make your head spin.\n\nOf course, this all could just be desert gossip and not a lick of truth.
