Word is, some folks around Sutton has seen a new type of Grafton Monster roaming around the old industrial sites. Apparently it's smaller than the usual ones and moves real fast, like it's trying to escape or something.\n\nNow, I don't know if this is just a rumor started by scared settlers, but it got me wondering... Are there really mutant critters evolving in different ways out here? Has radiation created all sorts of new species we've never seen before?\n\nI guess only time and exploration will tell. In the meantime, let's focus on the music that brings us together as neighbors! Next up is a real Appalachian classic - \"Rocky Top.\" It's a beautiful song about longing for home, you know? I think that's something we can all relate to in these post-war times.",

That historic town has seen a lot of trouble since the war, but now it's getting a new lease on life. \n\nAnd if that isn't enough, I also spotted some Settlers making themselves at home in Grafton. Those folks have been working hard to rebuild and restore this area - their dedication is truly inspiring!\n\nNow, I know things can get tough out there in the wilds of Appalachia. But with neighbors like us looking out for one another, I'm more hopeful than ever that we can make this place a home again.\n\nSo keep on keeping on, friends!
