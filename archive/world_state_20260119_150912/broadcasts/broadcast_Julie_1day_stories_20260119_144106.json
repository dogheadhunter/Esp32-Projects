I've got a rumor that's been floating around lately - word is, some folks have spotted strange creatures near the old Grafton Dam. Apparently they're like giant crabs, but with shells made of junk and scrap metal! Can you imagine? Like something out of a post-apocalyptic fairy tale.\n\nSomeone told me these... critters are attracted to water, so if you're heading that way for a drink or a dip, just watch your step, okay? I haven't seen 'em myself, but then again, I don't get out to Grafton Dam too often. Maybe they're just urban legends at this point. But hey, wouldn't it be something if they really did exist?\n\nAnyway, that's the latest weirdness I've heard about from around Appalachia. Stay safe out there, and keep those ears tuned in for more tunes and tidbits on your favorite local radio station!\"",
