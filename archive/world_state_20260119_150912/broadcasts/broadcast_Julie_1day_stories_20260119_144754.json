Word is, a group of settlers down near the old New River Gorge bridge spotted a rather unusual creature. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Julie, it's Appalachia, we've seen all sorts of weird stuff.\" And you're right! But allegedly, this critter had an extra pair of legs. Like, four instead of two.\n\nSomeone told me they thought it might have been some sort of mutated hare or jackrabbit, but honestly? That sounds far-fetched even for us post-apocalyptic folks. I mean, I've heard tales of ghouls and super mutants, but a four-legged rabbit? That's new to me! Still, if you're out that way and see anything strange hopping around, be sure to give it a wide berth and let us know!\n\nWell, enough weirdness for now. Here's another favorite: \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" by John Denver. Let's all just take a moment and appreciate the beauty of these mountains we call home, even if they're a little more radioactive than before. Stay safe out there, neighbors!",
