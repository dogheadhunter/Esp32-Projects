Now, I don't know if that's true or just his imagination running wild, but it got me thinking.\n\nI mean, we've heard stories about giant insects and mutated creatures out there, right? But have you ever really seen 'em? Word is, some folks are starting to venture further into the wilderness, exploring old ruins and such. Could be they're spotting more of those big critters than we know.\n\nStill, it's always interesting to hear what people claim to see out there in the wilds. Like that time I heard about a friendly super mutant who was just trying to help, or the rumors of hidden underground vaults with treasure inside... Okay, maybe not so 'hidden' anymore, given all the explorers these days! Anyway, that's your gossip for now. Stay curious, Appalachia!\"",

So I heard from someone who claims to have been at Vault 76 on Reclamation Day that when they first opened those doors... well, let's just say it wasn't exactly a parade outside. Apparently the Scorched were already causing trouble and there was a big ol' mess waiting for our brave pioneers.\n\nNow, don't go spreading rumors about the poor folks who ventured out into all that danger! But word is they found some weird stuff in the ruins - like furniture still intact after all these years. Can you imagine? I mean, it's not every day you stumble upon a perfectly preserved armchair from before the bombs fell.\n\nAnyway, just thought I'd pass along this little tidbit of history... or maybe 'historical fiction' is more like it! If you're out there and you're listening... you are not alone.\"",

Imagine reading about what life was like, just before everything went nuclear. I'd love to get my hands on some of those someday.\n\nAnyway, enough gossip for now.
