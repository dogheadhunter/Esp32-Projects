Someone told me it's buried deep in one of those caves, but no one knows which one yet.\"\n\n\"I mean, I don't know if this is true or not. But if it is... man, that'd really help a lot of folks out here, you know? Could go a long way towards rebuilding and all. So, if you're heading to Cranberry Glades anytime soon, keep an ear out for rumors about hidden treasure, I guess! Just remember, always be careful in those caves. And hey, even if there's no cash... the scenery is still pretty amazing.\"",

Well, I heard something pretty interesting recently. Apparently, some folks down near the old Poseidon Energy Plant have spotted a pack of super mutated hounds! Now, I haven't seen 'em myself, but someone told me they're huge - like three or four times bigger than regular wolves. And from what I understand, these beasts are super aggressive too.\n\nI mean, it's always exciting to hear about new sights and sounds out there in the wilds of Appalachia. At the same time, you gotta wonder if maybe those folks should avoid that area for a while until they figure out what's going on with these hounds. But hey, as long as no one gets hurt, right? Maybe we'll get some brave explorers to come back and tell us more about 'em sometime. In the meantime, let's focus on something more uplifting... like this next song! Stay safe out there, everyone.",
