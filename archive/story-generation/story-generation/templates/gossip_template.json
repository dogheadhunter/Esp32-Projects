One trader told me she once carried a wounded volunteer three miles through a radstorm. Three miles! I mean, I get tired walking to my equipment rack. *laughs* But seriously, people like her... they're why we're even still here. Makes me want to be better, you know? Anyway, just thought you'd want to know about her."
