And the Responders... they didn't have to do anything. They were survivors too. They had their own problems. But they chose to help anyway. I've been listening to this holotape - it's from the early days, maybe 2078? And there's this woman, I think she was a nurse before the war, and she's just... she's exhausted. You can hear it in her voice. But she's talking about staying up all night treating radiation burns, and she says this thing that like... it stuck with me. She says 'I help because I remember what it felt like when someone helped me.' And I just... *pause* I think about that a lot. You know? Because we're all struggling. We're all scared. But maybe that's exactly when we need to help each other most. When it's hard. The Responders understood that. They built something beautiful out of ashes. And yeah, they're gone now. The Scorched... they took so much from us. But their idea? That we take care of each other? That's still here. That's what you're doing when you share supplies with a stranger. When you warn someone about danger. When you just... listen to this radio show. *laughs softly* We're all Responders now, in a way. We just have to choose it. Anyway, I just... I wanted to share that with you. Thanks for listening."
