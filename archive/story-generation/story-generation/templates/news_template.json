Flatwoods, Charleston Fire Department... satellites show the structures are intact. If you're heading that way, there might still be supplies. Medical gear, fire equipment... um, just watch for Scorched activity near the airport. Second thing - picked up some radio chatter about people visiting the Overseer's memorial in Flatwoods. It's becoming like... a gathering spot? People leaving flowers, notes. I think that's beautiful. Shows we still care, you know? Last item - Morgantown Airport is hot right now. Lots of Scorched movement. I'd avoid it for a few days if you can. That's what I've got for now. Stay informed, stay safe."
