Toxic Valley, um... yeah, it's living up to its name. Heavy rads near Grafton, satellite's picking up toxic fog. I'd wait a day or two if you can. Cranberry Bog is... well, it's the Bog. Always high radiation, but I'm seeing increased scorchbeast activity around Watoga. Maybe they're nesting? Just, you know, keep your eyes up. That's the forecast. Be careful, friends."
