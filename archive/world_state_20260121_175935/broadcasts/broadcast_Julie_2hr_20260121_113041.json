But trust me, we're all in this together. Here's a little rumor I heard recently that made me smile... Word is, over by the Cranberry Glades, there's a hidden garden, abandoned before the war. Apparently, it's still thriving with wild flowers, despite everything. Someone told me they saw an old pickaxe lying around, too, so if anyone's looking for some gardening tools...\n\nAnyway, enough about that for now. Let's focus on the music! Here's another fan favorite - \"The Gambler\" by Kenny Rogers. I think we can all relate to those lyrics these days, don't you? Hope and resilience in the face of uncertainty... That's what keeps us going out here.\n\nStay safe, and keep an ear on Radio Appalachia!",

Now, I don't know if it's true or just another tall tale, but that does sound pretty scary!\n\nI mean, we've all heard about the weird creatures out here, right? Like those giant radtoads and scorchbeasts. But mutated ants attacking settlements? That'd be a whole new level of trouble! \n\nAnyway, I'm not gonna spread panic or anything. Just passing on the rumor, like how some folks share songs around campfires. Maybe we'll find out it's just another urban legend, like those stories about ghouls being super smart and organized.\n\nIn any case, let's focus on the good stuff, shall we? Here's a classic for you all: \"Country Roads\" by John Denver!",
