Someone told me it's not even on the maps, but supposedly Vault 87 is real and still intact. Can you imagine? A whole vault full of people who survived the Great War! \n\nOf course, word is the entrance is heavily guarded by those nasty Scorched. So if anyone's planning a trip there, make sure you bring plenty of med-x and a strong gun. I mean, I haven't tried to find it myself, but hey, maybe one day we'll uncover some big secrets.\n\nAnyway, let's focus on the music! Here's \"Wild Horses\" by The Rolling Stones - another pre-war favorite that seems to still resonate with us in the wasteland today. Stay safe out there and keep those ears tuned to Appalachia Radio!",

But apparently, it's been seen by multiple people in different parts of the region.\n\nSomeone told me they even tried to help the poor thing, 'cause it was struggling a bit. Guess those extra brains might be more of a hindrance than a help sometimes? I mean, imagine having two minds trying to work together! That'd be like... well, I don't know what that would be like, but probably something.\n\nAnyway, just thought you should hear about this strange sight. Take it for what it's worth - maybe just a myth or an overactive imagination running wild. But hey, if you do spot that two-headed Brahmin, give it some extra oats from me, okay? This is Julie, signing off for now. Stay safe out there!",
