Some folks say they're just mutated regular ants, but others claim they're straight outta a horror movie. Apparently, these behemoths have been spotted in the northern parts of the map, maybe even around Watoga.\n\nNow, I don't know if there's any truth to this, but it's sure got folks talking! Someone told me they found some kinda anthill near an old factory, and when they tried to investigate, these massive ants started swarming out. Scary stuff!\n\nOf course, with the state of things post-war, you can never be too careful. If you do happen to encounter any giant ants out there, just remember: they're probably more scared of you than you are of them! So keep your wits about you and maybe bring some bug spray, just in case.\n\nThat's all for now, friends. Stay safe out there, and don't forget to tune in next time on Appalachia Radio!",
