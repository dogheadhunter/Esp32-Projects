Word is, it's loaded with pre-war tech and even some actual weapons from before the bombs fell. Now, I don't know if any of that's true - but wouldn't it be something to find a real arsenal? Like, what would you even do with all those guns?\n\nSomeone told me there might've been a few skeletons in there too, which gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it. But hey, at least the rumors say they're pretty far under the earth so you won't stumble across 'em unless you really dig deep.\n\nAnyway, if you're out there and you hear anything more about this supposed bunker, let me know, okay? I'm always curious to see what our fellow wastelanders are up to. Stay safe out there!",

Word is, there's a group of raiders out near Beckley that are obsessed with the Charleston Sun newspaper. Like, they collect every issue they can find and use it for something. I'm not sure what exactly, but rumor has it it's pretty weird.\n\nSomeone else told me about a hidden bunker down by the New River Gorge where people have been stockpiling all sorts of junk food and snacks. You know, like Doritos and Twinkies that are so old they're practically artifacts now! I mean, who knows, maybe in the apocalypse, those things will be gourmet cuisine or something.\n\nAnyway, just some strange stories floating around out there. Don't mind me, just your friendly neighborhood DJ sharing some gossip and tunes to pass the time. Stay safe, everybody!",
