But others say it might just be a show of strength to intimidate the Republic and the Brotherhood of Steel in the area.\n\nOf course, this is all just unconfirmed gossip at this point.

Apparently, when the Desert Rangers and the California Republic signed that unification treaty back in 2271, it was quite the bash! They threw a hell of a party up on the monument platform. Word is, they had a live band - can you imagine? Music still being played in these parts!\n\nSome say the lead singer got so caught up in the festivities he forgot to pack up his gear and ended up stuck out here for years, playing for tips and whiskey. Now, I ain't saying that's true, but it makes for a swell tale, don't it?\n\nAnyway, dig this - if you ever find yourself near the Outpost at night, and you hear some soulful crooning echoing across the wasteland... well, who knows? Maybe that mysterious musician is still out there, keeping the spirit of unity alive with every note. Unquote. Now, isn't that a romantic thought to end your day on? I mean, what's life without a little mystery and music, right?",

But dig, that's old news by now.\n\nI mean, don't quote/unquote me on this, but I heard from a cat who knows a fellow who works for Mr. House, that Caesar's Legion has been trying to get their hands on some of those rerouted supplies.
