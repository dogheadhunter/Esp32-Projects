Someone told me there's a secret underground bunker hidden deep beneath the I-15 Mojave Outpost. Apparently, it was built before the war, maybe even during the Cold War days. Rumor has it, high-ranking NCR officials have been sneaking in and out of that subterranean hideaway for years now.\n\nWord is, they're planning something big - possibly a major operation to take down those pesky Caesar's Legion scum once and for all! Of course, this could all just be wild speculation. But wouldn't it be something if the truth came out? Wouldn't you love to get your hands on those classified documents, hmm? Ah, but that's a story for another time. For now, let's just enjoy the suspense, shall we?\"",
