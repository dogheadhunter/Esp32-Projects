Maybe there are still some old settlements out there, hidden away from the rest of us. You know, like little pockets of survivors who managed to hang on after everything went to hell.\n\nI mean, can you imagine stumbling upon a whole town of people living in secret? It'd be like finding a piece of the old world again!
