Released all the way back in 1958, this upbeat rock 'n' roll hit was one of the last singles from this talented young musician before his untimely passing. I mean, can you believe it's been over six decades since he first recorded it? But his music still holds up so well today.

Now, I don't know about you, but that stuff ain't exactly good for us humans. Maybe it's just rumors, but someone told me they saw a few of those bioluminescent mushrooms poking out from under some rubble. Word is, if you're brave (or foolhardy) enough to venture in there and find some, be sure to harvest responsibly. We don't need no contaminated crops or anything! Just thought I'd pass that along for your consideration. Stay safe out there, friends!",

Or is it just another tall tale from around the campfire?\n\nAnyway, enough about creepy mutated critters for now. Let's shift gears and enjoy some great tunes!

Now, I know those places can be pretty treacherous, but apparently these Mirelurks are big, fat, and healthy looking. Word is they've even been found with some of their shells still glowing! It's making me wonder if there might be a Glowing Sea nearby that we don't know about yet.\n\nOf course, this could all just be wild speculation, but it's definitely piqued my curiosity.

Someone told me they've even got a carousel going again, with painted ponies instead of metal statues 'cause all that plastic broke down years ago. It sounds like a real community effort too - people coming together to make something fun out of nothing. That's the spirit I love seeing around here.\n\nAnyway, speaking of something fun... time for another classic! Here's John Denver and \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\". Let's see if it still holds up as our favorite after all these years.",

Now, I don't know if this is just some wild tale or actual fact. But word is, it's a real game-changer for survival out here. \n\nI mean, we all know how precious water can be. So even if it's not true, the thought of finding such a stockpile is pretty exciting! Has anyone else heard this rumor? Maybe we should send some explorers to check it out and report back. Until then, let's keep on listening and hope for the best in these trying times. And hey, here's \"Country Roads\" again - seems like everyone loves that one!",

Could machines really develop feelings over time? It's wild to consider.\n\nAnyways, that's the latest gossip I've heard. Take it for what you will! And hey, on a more uplifting note, word is the new settlement by Abandoned Bog is growing fast. Lots of folks moving in and making it their home.

Or maybe it was all in their heads! These things happen in the wasteland sometimes. Still, it's a sweet thought, and who knows?

Now, I don't know if that's true, but it sure would be interesting to see one up close... and personal.\n\nI heard another story about some trader who found an old, working phone in the ruins of Beckley.

Maybe there's hope for rebuilding our tech infrastructure after all.\n\nThat's all for now, folks. Just remember: if you're out there, and you're listening... you are not alone.

Folks are saying they've seen shadowy figures darting between the old mining equipment late at night. Spooky stuff!\n\nNow, I know these are just rumors and stories... but hey, it's always fun to speculate! We're all just trying to make sense of this post-apocalyptic world we live in.

Word is they've gotten pretty aggressive too. Now, I don't know if this is just paranoia or actual danger, but it might be worth keeping an eye out when you're traveling through there.\n\nOn a brighter note, I heard rumors that some of the settlers have started a little farmstead up in the southeastern part of the map, around the site of an old campground. They're supposedly growing crops and raising animals to help rebuild and sustain their community. That's the kind of hope we need out here! If true, they'd be setting a great example for the rest of us.\n\nThat's all for now, folks. Just some tidbits from the wasteland grapevine.

Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Glowing Fungus? That sounds like a recipe for disaster!\" And trust me, it is not something to mess around with.\n\nApparently, they've got this eerie green glow and can release those nasty spores that'll get ya real sick real fast. So, if you're planning on delving into the depths of Appalachia's subterranean world anytime soon, be sure to pack some Rad-X or whatever you use to keep those radiation levels in check. And always, always have a buddy with you - safety in numbers and all that jazz.\n\nThat's all for now, folks. Stay safe out there, and remember - the radio waves are here for you, no matter where your adventures take you.

I don't know much more than that, but hey, if there's a group of survivors working together to make a better life for themselves... well, that's just wonderful news.\n\nYou know how it is around here \u2013 rumors fly fast \u2013 but even if this Prosperity Hills thing isn't real, it's nice to dream about folks coming together and making the most of this harsh new world we're living in. Keep on keeping on out there, and I'll keep the tunes flowing!",

Maybe we'll have some brave adventurers track one down and share their tale on air sometime soon. Until then, stay safe, keep exploring, and remember: Appalachia Radio is here for you! \"",

Can you imagine? I mean, that would be something, right? A double-headed Brahmin roaming around. It sounds crazy, but then again, we're living in post-apocalyptic West Virginia now, so who knows?\n\nWord is there are more of those strange critters out there, like super-mutants and whatnot. Now, I don't know if any of that's true, but it does make for some interesting stories, doesn't it? Anyway, enough about that spooky stuff. Let's focus on the music!

Maybe just normal mole rats, maybe not. Hard to say for sure without going down and checking ourselves, right? I mean, that place is crawling with Grahams and those weird glowing plants...not exactly an inviting spot for a midnight stroll.\n\nWord is if this giant rat does exist, it's been seen carrying off corpses from the vault. Now I'm no expert, but that doesn't sound like mole rat behavior to me. Unless...it's developed a taste for human flesh or something? Scary thought! Anyway, just sharing what I heard.

Someone told me this group even has their own makeshift factory churning out parts and weapons.\n\nNow, I haven't found it myself yet, but Bucky swears he's seen their smoke signals at night. He claims they're super friendly and will trade with outsiders... as long as you come bearing useful junk, of course! So if any of y'all are brave enough to venture that way, keep your eyes peeled for those strange campfires.\n\nThat's the latest rumor I've heard floating around out there in the wasteland. Just remember, even if it's true, always be cautious when dealing with new faces and groups. Stay safe and keep on scavengin'!",

And hey, at least it wouldn't get lost so easy, right? Anyway, that's the latest rumor floating around these parts. Take it for what you will, neighbors!",

Stay safe out there, and thanks for tuning in to Appalachia Radio!",

Now, normally, we wouldn't think twice about ghouls doing ghoul stuff... but this was different. The rumor is they're trying to restore it for some kind of... event?\n\nWord is, if they succeed, Vault 81 might just become a hotspot for, well, not exactly 'parties', but gatherings none the less! Some folks are excited at the prospect of meeting new people and making friends in such an isolated place. Others are, understandably, a bit spooked by the idea of mingling with ghouls.\n\nSo there you have it - just another rumor swirling around our beloved Appalachia! Take it for what it's worth, but always remember... If you're out there, and you're listening... you are not alone. Stay safe, stay curious, and keep on tuning in!",

So if you're feeling brave and wanna go hunting for a two-headed brahmin, I hear the best time to look is at dusk, when they're most active. But hey, be careful out there! Last thing we need is some mutated livestock causing trouble in our little corner of Appalachia. Stay safe, everyone!",

Word is, there's been some sightings of Glowing Ones in the old mines. Now, I don't know if this is true or just wild speculation, but supposedly they've been seen near the train stations too. \n\nSome people are saying it could be connected to that strange light that's been popping up on the horizon at night. Have any of you out there noticed anything weird? I mean, we all know these parts can get a little spooky in the dark.\n\nAnyway, just thought I'd pass this along and see if anyone else has heard anything similar. Always good to share info and stay safe out there! \n\nNext up on Appalachia Radio, it's that classic favorite - \"Country Roads\" by John Denver. You know, for me, this song always brings a sense of hope and longing. Maybe it's because I'm from around here originally. Anyway, grab a bottle of water, put your feet up, and let the music wash over you while we enjoy this beautiful tune together!",
