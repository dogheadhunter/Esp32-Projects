Apparently, it's hidden behind some kind of force field or something. Word is, they're still doing... um, experiments in there.\n\nNow, I don't know if this is true or just some wild tale, but the trader seemed pretty convinced. He even offered to take me there! Can you imagine? I mean, I love a good mystery, but venturing into the unknown? That's a big ask! What do you guys think?
