Apparently they're heading south or east, away from Vault 76 and all our friendly faces. Someone told me they saw a big horde cross over the Gorge, so maybe that's true? Word is, we might be seeing less of those pesky Scorched on Reclamation Day celebrations in the future.\n\nAlso, I heard there's been some new settlements popping up around Harpers Ferry and the Greenbrier area. Apparently they're friendly to travelers and even help with repairs if you've got the right stuff to trade. Not sure how reliable that rumor is, but it's always good news to hear of more communities coming together.\n\nHere's a song for all our friends who are building a new life in Appalachia - John Denver's \"Backwoods Bonus.\" Enjoy!",

I've got a little rumor floating around the wasteland that I thought I'd share with you all tonight.\n\nSo, word is... there's a settlement hidden deep in the woods near Harpers Ferry. Apparently, they're calling it 'Raven Rock'. Now, I haven't seen this place myself, but someone told me they caught a glimpse of it from afar - looks like an old factory or something. \n\nThey said the settlers there are super friendly and always willing to help out travelers who stumble upon their community. That's music to my ears after all we've been through! I mean, can you imagine having neighbors again? Friends? \n\nOf course, this could just be another wild wasteland tale, but it gives me hope all the same. Maybe there are more hidden gems like Raven Rock out there waiting for us to find. Until next time, stay safe and keep on singing!\n\nAppalachia Radio, signing off.\"",

I heard from someone who claims to have spotted one of those legendary Super Mutants up in the Cranberry Glades.

Some folks say it's just tales to scare new settlers, but others claim they've seen 'em with their own eyes.\n\nSo I don't know if there's any truth to this particular story. But hey, it does make for a pretty exciting rumor to toss around at the water cooler or over the campfire, doesn't it? Just remember, in these uncertain times, always take your gossip with a grain of salt and a healthy dose of skepticism!\n\nThanks for tuning in, everyone!

I don't know if it's true or just some tall tale to freak folks out, but it does sound pretty wild.\n\nSomeone told me they saw one up close and it was huge - bigger than any regular bear. And these creatures are said to travel in packs now too. That doesn't sound like anything natural at all! I'm not saying I believe it, but it sure makes for an interesting story over the campfire, you know?\n\nAnyway, that's your wasteland gossip for today. Take it for what it's worth - a fun rumor or maybe some truth we don't yet know about. Stay safe out there and keep those ears open! I'll catch you on the flip side of the dial, Appalachia!",
