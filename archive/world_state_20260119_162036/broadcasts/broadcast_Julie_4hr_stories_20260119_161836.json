Supposedly it's thriving, but the weird part is... it's entirely comprised of former Scorch Beasts! Apparently, some sort of radiation anomaly has altered their physiology to make 'em human-like again. Can you imagine running into one of those guys in town? That'd be a real jaw-dropper!\n\nSomeone told me there are hidden underground bunkers scattered all across Appalachia, just waiting for the right person (or robot) to stumble upon 'em. Word is they're filled with pre-war treasures - but only if you can navigate the traps and puzzles guarding each one.\n\nAnd finally, I heard a whisper about a mysterious figure known as \"The Keeper of Harpers Ferry\". Apparently this enigmatic character has taken it upon themselves to restore and repurpose old technology in that area. Could be interesting meeting them someday... or not, depending on their views on trespassers! \n\nThat's all for now - just a few tidbits from the wasteland grapevine. Stay curious, stay kind, and keep those radio dials tuned here for more!\"",
