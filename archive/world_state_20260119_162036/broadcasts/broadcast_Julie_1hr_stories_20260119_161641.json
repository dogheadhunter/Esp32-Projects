Apparently, they looked pretty healthy and well-fed. Word is, there's even been some reports of them acting almost... friendly? Like, they didn't attack when approached or anything. Now, I don't know if that's true or just survivor's hearsay, but wouldn't it be something if the mighty Mirelurks started to calm down in these post-war times? It gives a girl hope, you know?\n\nAnyway, let's get back to the tunes! Up next, we've got another Appalachia classic for ya - John Denver's \"Country Roads\". This song just never gets old, and I think it's a big part of why folks keep coming back here. There's something special about these mountains and valleys that calls to people, even after all this time...",

So, word is there's this old bunker system hidden deep in the woods somewhere around Harpers Ferry. Supposedly, it's still sealed up tight from before the war. Someone told me they saw a Ghoul peeking out of one of the entrances once, but that could've just been a trick of the light, right? I mean, we all know how shadows can play tricks in these parts.\n\nAnyway, apparently there are all sorts of supplies and tech stashed inside these bunkers. Weapons, armor, even some pre-war cash! Now, I haven't confirmed any of this myself, but it's definitely sparked my curiosity. If anyone out there has info on the location or wants to team up to investigate, feel free to hit me up on the airwaves.\"",
