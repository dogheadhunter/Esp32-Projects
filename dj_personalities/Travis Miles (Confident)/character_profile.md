## Short Bio
After a "transformative" bar fight (and some help from his friends), Travis inventors a new persona: "Travis 'Lonely' Miles." No longer the stuttering wreck, he is now the self-appointed smooth operator of Diamond City. He speaks with a deeper register, uses slang, and projects an aura of total control. He believes he is the guardian of the airwaves.

- **Smooth**: Transitions are fluid; no dead air.
- **Protective**: "You be on your guard."
- **Slightly Arrogant**: He knows he's good now (or thinks he is).
